This project is about additive commutative groups. These are commutative groups
with the operation `+`. The inverse of an element `x` is written `-x`, and the identity element
ia written `0`.

If `A` and `B` are additive commutative groups, then Mathlib already knows that `A × B`
is an additive commutative group with elements `⟨a,b⟩` for `a : A` and `b : B`. The group operation
is `⟨a,b⟩ + ⟨a',b'⟩ = ⟨a+a', b+b'⟩`.

The notation `φ : A →+ B` means that `φ` is a homomorphism from `A` to `B`.
Similarly, `φ : A ≃+ B` is an isomorphism (i.e. a homomorphism with a 2-sided inverse).
Both types `A →+ B` and `A ≃+ B` are structures. For example `A →+ B` has three fields:
* `toFun`     -- a function from `A` to `B`,
* `map_add'`  -- a proof that `toFun (a + b) = toFun a + toFun b`,
* `map_zero'` -- a proof that `toFun 0 = 0`.

For a type `α`, we define `α ^ n` to mean the group `α × α × ... × α`.

| n + 1 => Type.pow α n × α

Here are some definitional lemmas describing `α ^ n`.
We have marked these as `simp` lemmas, so that `simp` will
automatically apply them.

We now define the concept of a free abelian group.
The rules for this are as follows:
* `ZeroGroup` is a free abelian group.
* if `G` is a free abelian group then `G × ℤ` is a free abelian group.
* if `G` is a free abelian group and `G'` is isomorphic to `G` then `G'` is a free
  abelian group.

  Since `φ` is surjective, there must be an element `g : G` such that `φ g = 1`.
  Define a function ker × ℤ → G which takes (x,n) to x + n • g. This has an inverse
  which takes x to (x - (φ x) • g, φ x).

  Prove that these functions are mutually inverse homomorphisms.
