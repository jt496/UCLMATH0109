If `A : Finset α` then `Finset.card A` is its cardinality. We will use |A| as notation for this.

If we want to talk about a type `α : Type` that is finite we do this with a Fintype instance
[Fintype α]. The size of `α` is `Fintype.card α` and we use ‖α‖ as notation for this.

If A : Finset α then its complement Aᶜ may not be finite.
However Aᶜ will be finite if α is itself finite. (we will also assume α is nonempty.)

So from now on α is finite so if `A : Finset α` then `Aᶜ : Finset α`

We will now introduce some potentially confusing notation.

If `𝒜 : Finset (Finset α)` (i.e. 𝒜 is finite family of finite subsets of elements of α)
we will use `𝒜ᶜ` to denote the family of all complements of members of 𝒜, i.e.

    `𝒜ᶜ = { Aᶜ | A ∈ 𝒜}`

[We define this notation with the instance below. If you remove this instance
then Lean will interpret 𝒜ᶜ as the complement, in Finset (Finset α),
of the family 𝒜, i.e. as  {B | B ∉ 𝒜}.]

The following results may be useful in your formalization.

One useful operation on Finsets is `insert a s` which, if `s : Finset X`
and `a : X`, forms the Finset `s` with `a` inserted. This is the same as
`s ∪ {a}` but you will probably find `insert` much easier to work with.

Note that if 𝒜 is intersecting then so is `up 𝒜` so any maximally intersecting family
