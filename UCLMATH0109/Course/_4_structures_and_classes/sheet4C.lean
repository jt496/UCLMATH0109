Have a think about this one. Of course you could prove it by a very
long sequence of rewrites. However it is easier to prove a more general
statement by induction.
Alternatively you could try `apply?`, and try to find the most relevant
result.

Suppose `G` is a group in which `z ^ 2 = 1` for every element `z`.
Prove that `G` is abelian.

example (h : ∀ z : G , z ^ 2 = 1) :
    ∀ x y : G, x * y = y * x :=
by
  -- first prove that `z⁻¹ = z` for all elements `z` in the group.
  -- Using this formula in the case `z = y * x`,
  -- we get `(y * x)⁻¹ = y * x`.
  -- Next, simplify the left hand side to get `x⁻¹ * y⁻¹ = y * x`.
  -- After that, rewrite `x⁻¹` and `y⁻¹` as `x` and `y`.

We defined th kernel of a homomorphism in question 10.
Prove that a homomorphism `φ` is injective iff its kernel is `{1}`.

In this last example, you might want to use `Set.mem_singleton_iff`.
You might also want to look up `Function.injective`.
