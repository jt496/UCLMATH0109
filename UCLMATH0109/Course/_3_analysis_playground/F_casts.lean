If `a : α` and `b : β`, then the expression `a = b` does not make
sense in Lean.

section
variable (α β : Type) (a : α) (b : β)
--#check a = b
/-
type mismatch
  b
has type
  β : Type
but is expected to have type
  α : Type

Lean is complaining that this doesn't make sense because `=` is only defined for
terms of the same type, so given the LHS `a : α` it was expecting the RHS of the
equality to also be a term of type A.

But as mathematicians we happily form expressions that involve terms
of different types.

For example if `n : ℕ` and `x : ℝ` then `x = n` is a perfectly reasonable proposition.

Lean requires us to convert the smaller type ℕ to the larger type ℝ.
This is called a `coercion` or `cast`
-/
variable (n : ℕ) (x : ℝ)
#check x = n -- x = ↑n, th `↑` in the Infoview indicates that a coercion has taken place
end

Below we describe the main tactics for dealing with these situations:
`norm_cast` and `push_cast`,

See https://lean-forward.github.io/norm_cast/norm_cast.pdf for more details.

If (n d : ℕ) then n / d is a natural number, n = (n / d) * d does not hold
unless d divides n. Instead we have `n = (n / d) * d + (n % d)` where `n % d` is
the remainder of n mod d,
