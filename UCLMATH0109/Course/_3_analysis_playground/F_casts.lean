If `a : A` and `b : B`, then the expression `a = b` does not make
sense in Lean.

variable (A B : Type) (a : A) (b : B)
 -- #check a = b
/-
type mismatch
  b
has type
  B : Type
but is expected to have type
  A : Type

Lean is complaining that this doesn't make sense because `=` is only defined for
terms of the same type, so given the LHS `a : A` it was expecting the RHS of the
equality to also be a term of type A.

But as mathematicians we happily form expressions that involve terms
of different types.

For example if `n : ℕ` and `x : ℝ` then `x = n` is a perfectly reasonable proposition.

Lean requires us to convert the smaller type ℕ to the larger type ℝ.
This is called a `coercion` or `cast`
-/
variable (n : ℕ) (x : ℝ)
#check x = n -- x = ↑n, th `↑` in the Infoview indicates that a coercion has taken place

/-
Below we describe the main tactics for dealing with these situations:
`norm_cast` and `push_cast`,

See https://lean-forward.github.io/norm_cast/norm_cast.pdf for more details.

If (n d : ℕ) then n / d is a natural number, n = (n / d) * d does not hold
unless d divides n. Instead we have `n = (n / d) * d + (n % d)` where `n % d` is
the remainder of n mod d,

The binomial coefficient `n.choose k` is the number of subsets of size k from
a set of size n. In Lean this is defined as:

def choose : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
  | _    , 0     => 1 (there is one empty set)
  | 0    , _ + 1 => 0 (the empty set has no subsets that are non-empty)
  | n + 1, k + 1 => n.choose k + n.choose (k + 1) Pascal's Identity

This definition may look odd, but has the big advantages of not involving either
subtraction or division in ℕ, both of which are awkward.

Note that `n.choose k = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)`, but this is a theorem not a definition
(and doesn't hold if n = 0 and k = 1).

Our last example can be solved using the following two results, together
with `norm_cast` and `apply?`
-/

#check div_lt_one -- if 0 < b then a / b < 1 ↔ a < b
#check Nat.choose_succ_succ -- Pascal's identity
