Prove the following formula
for the partial sums of the series `∑ (1 / ((n+1) * (n+2)))`.
You may find it helpful to prove the `have` statement first.

The next example is easy to solve using a `calc` block if you first find the
correct lemma from Mathlib.
(To do this you could introduce a `have` statement and use `apply?`.)

For this example first prove it on paper: `apply?` with the correct `have` statements
or in a `calc` block should do it.
