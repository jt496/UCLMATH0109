Each of `∧, ∨, →` is a binary operation on `Prop` (Why?). 

In order to understand compound propositions such as  `P ∧ Q → P ∧ R → P ∨ Q ∨ R`
(without using lots of brackets) we need to know how Lean parses such expressions.

Let's start with the single operation `→` and work out how Lean makes sense of the
expression: `P → Q → R`

There are two possiblities for how this could be defined:

  **left-associative**, so `P → Q → R` would be defined as `(P → Q) → R` or 
  **right-associative**, so `P → Q → R` would be defined as `P → (Q → R)`?

But which is it?

You will face many similar situations and the key to deciphering such 
expressions is to use the `#check` command and/or the `Infoview`. 
-/
variable (P Q R S : Prop)
#check (P → Q) → R -- (P → Q) → R : Prop
#check P → (Q → R) -- P → Q → R : Prop -- Look no brackets!
/-
So `→` is right-associative, since when we add brackets on the right Lean 
removes them in the Infoview. This tells us that they were not required.
-/
#check P → (Q → (R → S)) -- P → Q → R → S : Prop

  apply hqr

Our last proof was a `theorem` rather than an `example` so what's the difference?

An `example` is anonymous (i.e. it has no name) so we can't refer to it.
A `theorem` needs to have a name (and it must be unique)

(We can also have a `lemma` which, as far as Lean is concerned, is a theorem.)

With a theorem or lemma we can use `#check` to see what its statement says.
-/
#check imp_is_trans
/-
In our next example our goal is to prove `P → Q → P ∧ Q`.

Since this involves two binary operations, `→` and `∧`, we have another potential 
source of confusion.

If you can't see why there could a possible problem, consider the sum

    `2 + 4 + 6 / 3 = 8` 

We know this evaluates to `8` because of the BIDMAS rules which say that you do `/` 
before `+` (formally we say `/` has **higher precedence** than `+`). 

We don't usually write `2 + 4 + (6 / 3) = 8` because the brackets are not needed 
once you know the rules of BIDMAS.

Lean follows the same basic convention. Each binary operation is either left- or 
right-associative, and it also has a value associated to it that allows Lean to know
which to do first (i.e. the operation with the higher value has higher precedence).

So which has higher precedence `→` or `∧`? Again, we can work it out systematically.

This time we will use the Infoview (rather than #check)

Click here. Now move you cursor to hover over the Infoview.
The goal is `⊢ P → Q → P ∧ Q` 
If you hover over the `∧` in the goal you will see that the drop-down 
information says `P ∧ Q : Prop`, so there are implied brackets `(P ∧ Q)`.

We deduce that Lean gives `∧` higher precedence than `→` (it did `∧` first).

If you now hover over each of the `→` symbols in the goal you can deduce that Lean
parses this expression as `P → (Q → (P ∧ Q))` 

Lean follows the convention that it only displays brackets if they are required 
(i.e. if they change the default meaning of an expression)

In the next example our goal is `⊢ P ∨ Q ∨ R` so we first need to know whether 
`∨` is left- or right-associative.

Most of the binary operations you will have seen previously are associative:
for example `1 + (2 + 3) = (1 + 2) + 3` in `ℕ` and `a*(b*c) = (a*b)*c` in a group.

In fact `∨` and `∧` are both associative, but these are theorems not definitions!

The next example is something we will use a lot.

As mathematicians we have lots of theorems that say things 
like `if P and Q  are both true then R is true`.

Typically in Lean we express this as the equivalent proposition:
`P → Q → R`
